Pajamas (v0.10.0)
================

Pajamas is a simple AJAX library built for use with the [Q](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/) promise library.

This library has been tested against Chrome (latest), FF (latest), and IE9.

Usage
-----

Using the `pj` function, pass an object of options.
This should look familiar to jQuery:

    var promise = pj({
        url      : '/my/awesome/data.json'  // optional; the current url is assumed
      , dataType : 'json'                   // optional; 'json' is assumed
      , data     : {                        // optional; null is assumed
          whatever : 'you want'
        }
      , type     : 'GET'                    // optional; 'GET' is assumed
    })

Then, you can do whatever you'd normally do with a Q promise, such as:

    promise
    .then(function (value) {
        // do something with the JSON
      }
    , function (reason) {
        // reason is an instance of Error
        // reason.message is of the form "<method> <url>: <status code> <status text>"
        // also see reason.type, reason.url, reason.status, and reason.statusText
      })

POSTing your data is done in the exact same way as the GET, just change the `type` option to `"POST"`.
If you set the `dataType` to `'*'`, the promise will be resolved with the XHR object.
See more options below.


Options
-------

All parameters must be passed in as properties of a settings object.


### crossDomain

A cross-domain request can be forced by setting this value to `true`.

*Default*: inferred from URL


### contentType

The value for the `Content-Type` header.

*Default*: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'


### data

Data sent to the server.
This data is converted to a query string if it is not already a string.
To avoid processing the data, set the `processData` option to `false`.

*Default*: null


### dataType

The type of data that you are expecting to receive back from the server.
Valid options include 
'json', 'jsonp', 'script', 'text', 'html', 'xml', and '*'.
There is an attempt to infer the data type before the request is sent,
but it is not extremely sophisticated.

*Default*: 'json' if no inference is made


### delay

The amount of time in milliseconds to wait to send the request.
This can be useful when simulating latency.


### headers

A map of header key/value pairs to send along with the request.
These key/value pairs may override the defaults like
'Accept', 'Content-Type', and 'X-Requested-With'.

*Default*: `{}` (depends on data type)


### timeout

The number of milliseconds to wait before aborting the request.
For scripts (including JSONP), this will cause the script tag to be removed from the DOM.


### type

The type of request to make ('GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE').

*Default*: 'GET'


### url

The URL to which the request is sent.

*Default*: The current page


### xhr

A function to generate your own XMLHttpRequest.
This can be extremely useful when mocking your remote calls.


Serialization
-------------

Pajamas has three methods for serialization: `param`, `serialize`, and `serializeArray`.
A fourth function, `val`, which is necessary for serializing form elements, is also available.
See [serialization-test.js](https://github.com/geowa4/pajamas/blob/master/test/serialization/serialization-test.js)
for more detailed examples than what's below.


### pj.serialize(elements...)

Takes form and input elements as a variable number of arguments.
Returns a query string representing the form.


### pj.serializeArray(elements...)

Takes form and input elements as a variable number of arguments.
Returns an array of objects of the following form:

    [
        {
            name  : 'elemName'
          , value : 'elemValue'
        }
      , {
            name  : 'otherName'
          , value : 'otherValue'
        }
    ]


### pj.val(element)

Takes a form element and returns its value.
Returns null if there is no value.


### pj.param(objectOrArray)

Takes an object or an array and returns a query string.
If an Array is passed in, it assumes the format returned by `pj.serializeArray`.

    > pj.param({foo:'bar', baz:'quux'})
    'foo=bar&baz=quux'

    > pj.param([{name:'foo', value:'bar'}, {name:'baz', value:'quux'}])
    'foo=bar&baz=quux'


AMD
---

Pajamas declares 'q' as it's sole dependency.
Therefore, if q.js is not discoverable, you will likely need to define a path.
See [amd-test.js](https://github.com/geowa4/pajamas/blob/master/test/amd/amd-test.js) for an example.


Ender
-----

When using Ender, Pajamas can be accessed without alteration using Ender's mock CommonJS implementation.

    > var pj = require('pajamas')

Since Pajamas requires Q, Q's static methods are added to `ender` (a.k.a `$`) as well.

    > $.when(valueOrPromise)
    > require('Q').when(valueOrPromise)

The static method `param` is added without modification to Ender.

    > $.param(objectOrArray)

The static methods `serialize`, `serializeArray`, and `val` require DOM elements so they are added to `ender.fn`.
The modification simply applies the internal collection as arguments to `pj.serialize` and `pj.serializeArray`.

    > $('#form').serialize()
    > $('#form').serializeArray()
    > $('#username').val()


Building
--------

If you would like to build Pajamas on your own you will need to do the following.

1. `npm install`
1. `npm test`

Alternatively, you can install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally.
In the project directory, you will still need to run `npm install` to install all local dependencies.
Then, you may freely run any Grunt command defined in grunt.js.


Roadmap
-------

### v1.0

Use this for my own website.
Cleanup.
